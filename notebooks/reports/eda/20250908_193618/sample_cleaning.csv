"i received this product for free from influenster for me to review it. i have sensitive, combo skin prone to breakouts. i have used the product four times now (twice a week for 20 min as it states) and so far, this is my opinion: it has a very nice texture to it, nice and mild scent, very easy to apply and to take off; however, i haven’t really noticed any results (my pores still look the same, although it does exfoliate; also my skin doesn’t feel bouncier or looks more hydrated). i can’t really comment on wrinkle appearance since i have none. i will continue to use it and will probably see some results at some point. one plus is that it did not break me out (i have sensitive skin and that is a concern for me).","i received this product for free from influenster for me to review it. i have sensitive, combo skin prone to breakouts. i have used the product four times now (twice a week for 20 min as it states) and so far, this is my opinion: it has a very nice texture to it, nice and mild scent, very easy to apply and to take off; however, i haven’t really noticed any results (my pores still look the same, although it does exfoliate; also my skin doesn’t feel bouncier or looks more hydrated). i can’t really comment on wrinkle appearance since i have none. i will continue to use it and will probably see some results at some point. one plus is that it did not break me out (i have sensitive skin and that is a concern for me)."
"decent product for gentle exfoliation, however, the amount that i found i needed to use was more than i anticipated. for ’daily exfoliation’ use, it took a dime to nickel size amount of product just to feel like my skin was actually being exfoliated and not just ’washed.’ in the long run, i’d be going through a lot more product than i’d like to and that can get expensive. it’s good for a weekly face scrub, but i wouldn’t use it daily.","decent product for gentle exfoliation, however, the amount that i found i needed to use was more than i anticipated. for ’daily exfoliation’ use, it took a dime to nickel size amount of product just to feel like my skin was actually being exfoliated and not just ’washed.’ in the long run, i’d be going through a lot more product than i’d like to and that can get expensive. it’s good for a weekly face scrub, but i wouldn’t use it daily."
definitely not one i’d even recommend for combination skin as it offers very little hydration. it’s a light weight gel that delivers moisture for pretty much the time it takes for it to sink in but the moisture simply doesn’t last. i believe it would be better suited for the oilier ladies as it made my dry areas feel even drier and i had to follow up with an oil. i do like the lotion version of this as it’s much mor hydrating without making you feel oily,definitely not one i’d even recommend for combination skin as it offers very little hydration. it’s a light weight gel that delivers moisture for pretty much the time it takes for it to sink in but the moisture simply doesn’t last. i believe it would be better suited for the oilier ladies as it made my dry areas feel even drier and i had to follow up with an oil. i do like the lotion version of this as it’s much mor hydrating without making you feel oily
really enjoy the packaging and product but find this isn’t moisturizing enough for winter months,really enjoy the packaging and product but find this isn’t moisturizing enough for winter months
"melts away eye makeup quickly. i use it as a double cleanse to take off sunscreen and makeup, then follow with a regular cleanser. large amount in package since you don’t really need much. it melts in your hand to a liquid to spread all over. then i add a little water to get it cloudy and gently rub all over. haven’t broken out at all and love how there is no scent.","melts away eye makeup quickly. i use it as a double cleanse to take off sunscreen and makeup, then follow with a regular cleanser. large amount in package since you don’t really need much. it melts in your hand to a liquid to spread all over. then i add a little water to get it cloudy and gently rub all over. haven’t broken out at all and love how there is no scent."
