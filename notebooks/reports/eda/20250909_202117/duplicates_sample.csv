i received this product complimentary for testing purposes. i use this product after drying my face after a shower or washing it. it has made my skin feel softer and when used with the violet-c brightening serum (also complimentary) it really rejuvenated my skin. i was skeptical at first due to its watery appearance thinking it wouldn’t do much but it’s certainly affected my complexion. one thing i’ve noticed the most is the dark circles under my eyes have gotten brighter while using these products together.,POS
"amazing product! i’ve only been using it for a week and i can already see such a difference with my pores. the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because of the packaging. when you shake it up, it collects product in the cap and it spills down in the bottle and makes everything so sticky. the bottle comes with a stopper so don’t throw that out! it helps to keep the product from spilling which was a waste.",POS
"for the high price-tag i honestly had high hopes for this product. i did find that it moisturized my super dry skin but that was about it, i could not see any other improvement on my skin. i did not break me out, so that’s why i give it 3 stars. i did received this product for free in exchange of my honest opinion.",NEU
i wear waterproof mascara and this removes it with a little extra effort and a washcloth. it does sting if it gets in your eyes and may cause the vision to be slightly blurry but does a great job at removing my makeup,POS
it has a smooth creamy consistency. it left my skin feeling hydrated and not oily.,POS
"very underwhelmed by this product. typically when you pay a higher price for a product, you get what you pay for.. you use less product and get a superior result...but not with this product. my first impression was that the tube was much smaller than i was expecting (a high price for such a little amount of product). my second impression was that you seriously need a lot of this product to feel like it’s covered your face.. so you’re using more product than you should usually have to with an superior product.third impression, it doesn’t feel like it’s doing a good job at cleaning my face. yes, the scrub is very gentle and you can use it every day, but it does not provide the result that i would ultimately expect from this product. lastly, the packaging lacking as well. the lid can be hard to put back on especially if using it in the shower. i will not be buying this again.",NEG
"i rarely rate products, but i’ve been so impressed with this. i’ve always had redness in my skin and this completely eliminates any discoloration and offers a smooth, even look. i’ve also noticed my foundation last longer throughout the day.",POS
"i got a small jar of this in a beauty box and loved it so much i immediately purchased the full size. i put this on my face after moisturizer and i don’t even have to wear foundation. it covers the redness on my cheeks, nose, and chin and my skin just looks so much better. the smell is nice, not too strong, and reminds me of the beach.",POS
"i love yttp products but this one was just okay, wouldn’t repurchase. don’t see improvement in my skin compare to when i use other cleansers. i have combination skin.",NEU
this is a great balm that gets rid of impurities and makeup easily. no fragrance so it kind of smells like old playdoh to me but i could get past it. there is no scoop included so you have to use your fingers or get your own tool. be careful of using this to remove eye makeup as your vision will be cloudy afterwards for a couple minutes. eye drops can offset this quickly. i finished the entire container but will not repurchase only because of the smell. if you have sensitive skin and need something no fuss this is a great option.,POS
