I found that every time I wore makeup I broke out the next day. I was using the daily microfolient, the original and I thought I would give this a try. And when I did I shiz you not, any problem I was having with my skin disappeared within a couple of uses. I no longer break out after wearing my makeup and the redness around my nostrils is gone! I use this product every day. I highly recommend!"

I have done this for over 15 years. Usually once a day. Because it is so good at polishing my skin there is no need for expensive procedures, injections, etc. Trust me - I tried some procedures and they are a waste of money! And because of this formula, my other skin products are exponentially more effective - it's a win, win! My skin is still glowing and fresh. And at 58 and I still get compliments daily - asking me how I keep my skin so gorgeous (and shocked when I tell people my age!). No joke!"

Thank goodness for reviews! I absolutely love this product. I have acne prone skin and it particularly plagues me on my cheek area. As a result I have marks that have been significantly diminished since using this not to mention breakouts have been non-existent. I also use the powerbright dark spot serum they make as well. It's been a little over a week since I've started using but with these type of results this soon, I can't wait to see what my skin looks like in 3 months!

It is very drying, burns my eyes, and is way overpriced. I'm a long time Dermalogica fan and have been using their products for many years. Ultracalming Cleanser + Essential Cleansing Solution have been my holy grail cleansers for almost 15 years. But, unfortunately, now I'm going to have to research other skincare lines' hydrating cleansers. I would definitely not buy this cleanser again. At 43, the last thing I need is a cleanser that dries out my skin. Please consider bringing back Essential Cleansing Solution!"

The first time I didn't notice much difference at all besides a little redness (keep in mind I'm AA and brown skin). The second time I used it, I had splotchy rash like bumps across my forehead. I hadn't used anything new besides this. My skin is normal/combo and not really sensitive but something in this doesn't agree with my skin. Besides the fact it sucks, it's way too expensive. I've used lots of exfoliators that were cheaper but better than this. Save your money."

Please!,"Despite its name, the product is too harsh on my skin. It dries out my skin, making it feel uncomfortable. I have to use much more moisturizer and serums to sort off balance it out while sleeping. I was using the Essential Cleansing Solution for years and years and never had that issue, it was the best cleanser ever. It would hydrate the skin and cleanse perfectly. I understand that sometimes you would want to extend the portfolio and evolve / improve products, but in my personal opinion this was a miss. I wish the Essential Cleansing Solution had not been discontinued, I am still looking for a replacement and unfortunately it has made me look at other brands after being a Dermalogica user for 10+ years."

I'm very strict with my skincare regime and am a lover of skincare products, so this one seemed like a great new addition! I have normal skin and at the time of use, had no acne or open acne marks/other impurities. I followed the directions percisely and it seemed as though my skin really reddened from the product, enough so that one of my go-to heavy foundations wouldn't even cover it. I woke up the next morning to my skin peeling off on my cheeks, leaving behind open sores & burns that have now scarred. Ulta was very helpful in the matter and I contacted actual company Dermalogica with pictures and asking for advice on how to fix this and never received word back. I do not have overly sensitive skin so I don't know why this happened. I would just be cautious when using this product, especially if a lot of redness appears right after!"

Essential Cleansing Solution cleaned my skin very well without causing dryness or any irritation. I agree with other folks here who have written comments, Dermalogica has replaced Essential Cleansing Solution with a less satisfactory product that is twice as expensive.

I've always believed in exfoliating but wasn't always regular with it as I never really saw that much difference. I started using Thermafoliant a couple of months ago and was immediately taken with how unbelievable my skin felt afterwards - it felt like satin, almost slippery smooth. It also feels really nice with the warming effect. My skin overall is pretty good - I'm 41 but have minimal lines and am usually mistaken for early thirties, for which I credit using Dermalogica for over 10 years now and avoiding the sun. However I had an incredibly aggravating skin tag type thing next to my left eye that really bothered me. It was almost like a wart but skin coloured - maybe 4mm in diameter. It would occasionally flake but if I tried to remove it it was painful and would bleed - gross. My dermatologist told me he could surgically remove it but it might leave a scar so I put it off. However it was bothering me so much I was literally about to make the appointment for surgery when I suddently realised it had COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. No scar, no mark, nothing. It was like it was never there. The Thermafoliant had completely sloughed it off after just a few uses. So this product saved me an expensive dermatologist procedure that would probably have involved stitching and/or slight scarring. I've also had people comment on how good my skin looks at the moment, and that's in the middle of a brutally cold and dry east coast winter. My pores are visibly smaller, and my skin overall is clearer and looks younger. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. Please never change it!"

I had been using it for many years and loved it. This new formula is not the same and it does not feel as creamy, instead it feels more like liquid than a cream. It does not leave my face feeling moisturized like the Essential Cleansing Solution. Not to mention it is almost half the amount and cost more. So I will be returning it.

Recently i moved to a colder climate and realized my skin had these flaky dry patches on all of my healing pimples, and the clarisonic wasnt helping. Thats when i found this in the back of my drawer and decided to try again. You're supposed to massage it on your face for a full minute so the chemical exfoliant part kicks in, which i hadnt really done the first times i did it, so when i did it for the first time recently i realized this was my new holy grail. It delivers immediate results!!! My serums and moisturizer went on so smooth and immediately absorbed into my skin, and the next day i woke up with NO dry patches for the first time in months. I was SHOCKED. I dont use it daily, maybe 3 times a week when i dont use my clarisonic, but the difference is night and day.

Apparently Dermalogica has discontinued that product and replaced it with intensive moisture cleanser. I do not like the intensive moisture cleanser. It has dried my skin and has an unpleasant odor. Please bring bac essential cleansing solution!

What a difference Dermalogica has made for my skin after only 1 use! My pores are getting so cleaned out and this thermafoliant has really exfoliated to give smooth skin. It gets rid of any dryness you may be experiencing. It also gives you an even and smooth complexion that I noticed after only 1 use. When I put my foundation on, it gives that smooth porcelain look. I can't wait to see what my skin will look like in just 30 days since it's only been a week! I was using another high end department store skin system and that does not even compare to what Dermalogica can do for you! I am starting to sound like an infomercial but I am that impressed!! Try it, you can't go wrong!"

UGH!","I used the cleanser before they reformulated it with this, and this honestly sucks!!! It's overpriced, made my skin break out so badly, which by the way was completely controlled with the other cleanser (which didn't need reformulation). I have now returned ALL dermalogica products and switched to another brand in hopes of finding what works for my skin again. You've lost a few customers over this change. Way to go Dermalogica."

After every use my skin feels polished and oh so soft! A little goes a long way! This is the one product that truly turned me onto Dermalogica, 5 stars no doubt!"

The brand, itself, is entirely too expensive for me, therefore this is the only product I use from this brand due to the price, effectiveness and the fact it lasts a long time. I use this in my skincare routine 3 times per week."

Please bring back the essential cleansing solution. This product does NOT compare and is NOT improved/better as I was told at the NYC store. All I can do now is hope that my skin clears up before a wedding I have next weekend. :(
